## Program Change issue on Roland P-6

The manual says that the "Tx Program Change" setting "Sets whether program change messages are transmitted or not when the pattern changes", but this is not what happens. When a PC is sent, the machine immediately echoes the program change, effectively announcing that the program change is pending. When the program change is actuated, nothing happens. Video attached.
